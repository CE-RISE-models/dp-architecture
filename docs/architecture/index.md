# Architecture Overview

## Graphical Representation

*Graphical representation to be added - showing the architecture of core model, pluggable sections, cross-cutting models, and extension models*

## Model-Level Structure

The CE-RISE DPP architecture consists of:

- **Core Model**: product-profile (required foundation)
- **Pluggable Sections**: Independent models at the same level
- **Cross-cutting Models**: Reusable models across different contexts  
- **Extension Models**: Models that enrich and extend other models

For detailed specifications and internal structure of each model, see the individual component repositories.
