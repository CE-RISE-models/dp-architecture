# Aims & Objectives

The aim of the CE-RISE DPP & DMP data model architecture is to make Digital Product and Material Passports interoperable and generate value to users through proper representation of information and data. The architecture explicitly supports the distinct information needs of products and materials while sharing the same core structure and most value-added functionality.

## Core Objectives

### Proper Information Representation
We aim to represent information that is:

* **Complete** - capturing all necessary data for DPP & DMP functionality
* **Formal** - following structured, standardized formats
* **Semantically aligned** - ensuring consistent meaning across systems and contexts

### Future-Proofing
The architecture is designed to be future-proof for:

* Always evolving regulations and standards
* New data requirements and compliance needs
* Technological advances and platform changes

### Enabling Interoperability
We enable interoperability by:

* Supporting pluggable models that can be mixed and matched
* Allowing competing models for the same purpose without catastrophic cascading effects
* Preventing obsolescence or incompatibility in other parts of DPPs & DMPs
* Separating lifecycle concerns from regulatory requirements

### Semantic Web Vision
The ultimate aim is to harness the potential of automatic mappings and discoveries as envisioned in the semantic web - making sense of all the ontologies and enabling systems to automatically understand and work with diverse data models and standards.

This approach ensures that Digital Product and Material Passports can adapt, evolve, and maintain their value as the regulatory landscape and technological ecosystem continues to develop.

### Product–Material Continuity
The architecture is designed to support effective transmission of information between materials and products across lifecycle transitions. This includes material-to-product transformations in manufacturing and product-to-material transitions in recycling, ensuring information continuity when materials become products and products are recovered into materials.
